Zend_Service_Facebook

current status

 * 'old' REST client - working
 * 'new' OAuth2 (for graph) client - working
   * old rest endpoint inside OAuth2 - working

 * Unit Tests - none
 * Autoload - currently necessary (exceptions)

TODO list

 * fill out the rest of the old REST api (at least, parts that arent represented in Graph)
 * make non-autoload-required
 * move most of the 'identifier' arrays to somewhere central
 * transition to a 'global' oauth2 client library once one is available
 * make json/xml parsers symmetrical.  I think currently one makes arrays, one makes objects
